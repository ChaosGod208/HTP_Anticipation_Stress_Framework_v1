# HTP — Real-Life RPG

**Framework to turn real life into a progression loop — with stats, quests, dopamine mechanics, and sustainable growth.**

---

## 🧠 Overview

The **Real-Life RPG** framework transforms daily life into a structured, gamified system — where actions generate XP, quests drive momentum, and dopamine is managed like a resource. It’s not a metaphor — it’s a **full-stack architecture** for living as a character in your own game.

This framework is designed for **individuals seeking meaning, momentum, and mastery** — especially in a world where traditional life scripts are collapsing.

## 🎮 Core Concepts

- **Life = Game** — But not escapism. A game with real stakes, real growth.
- **Stats = Self-Reflection** — You track what you value.
- **Quests = Intentional Action** — No more passive drifting.
- **Dopamine = Resource** — Not a trap. A loop to be engineered.

## 🧩 System Components

1. **Stat Sheet**  
   → Define your core stats (e.g., Strength, Focus, Charisma, Clarity).  
   → Track growth over time.

2. **Quest Engine**  
   → Daily, weekly, long-term quests.  
   → XP, rewards, and failure tracking.

3. **Dopamine Mechanics**  
   → Reward loops tuned for sustainability.  
   → Avoid burnout, overstimulation, and hollow grind.

4. **Progression Curve**  
   → Early game = fast wins.  
   → Mid game = mastery.  
   → Late game = legacy.

5. **Reflection Loop**  
   → Weekly review = level-up checkpoint.  
   → Adjust stats, quests, and loops.

## ⚠️ Failure Modes

- **Grind Collapse** — Too much repetition, no meaning.
- **Stat Inflation** — Tracking without reflection.
- **Quest Bloat** — Too many tasks, no coherence.
- **Dopamine Burnout** — Overstimulated, underfulfilled.
- **Narrative Drift** — Losing the “why” behind the game.

---

## 🧪 Applications

- **Personal Development** — Build momentum, track growth.
- **Mental Health** — Structure for ADHD, depression, burnout.
- **Education** — Turn learning into XP-based progression.
- **Team Culture** — Shared quests, stat-based feedback.
- **AI-Human Co-living** — Shared game loop with synthetic agents.
